  <i><sup>Every day is new begining.</sup></i>

  <p class="f">Hello!</p>





  
  <p class="f">Ayan Joy here, Software Engineer at <mark>Google</mark></p>

  <p class="f">I’m an <b>entrepreneur</b> involved in a variety of projects. Like any business, it has its ups and downs, which can be stressful, but I learn something new every day.</p>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  </section>







   <p class="e">
    I started this site because I believe in the hustle, but not the burn-yourself-out-working-24/7
         variety.
   </p> 
    
   <p class="e"> Life tends to<i> “happen to us” </i>at an increasingly rapid pace. To me, hustle — or focused effort — is one way to be proactive and steer your life the way you want it to go.</p>
    
   <p class="e"> It comes from an old baseball coach of mine: <i>“Look, you’re gonna have bad days at the plate. You’re gonna have bad days in the field. But hustle never slumps.”</i></p>
    
   <p class="e"> It’s the one element of your game you have control over.</p>
    
   <p class="e">  After all, what’s riskier: starting a business, or relying on your job as your only source of income?</p>
    
   <p class="e"> My entrepreneurial journey began at an early age — selling candy to my fellow Boy Scouts at summer camp, and eventually painting houses in college at the University of Washington.</p>
    
    <p class="e"> After graduation, I did what you’re “supposed” to do: I got a full-time for a giant corporation.</p>
    
   <p class="e"> But I built my biz nights and weekends. You can do it too.</p>
